## ðŸŒ± Creating a New Branch for Your Task

When you're ready to start work on a new feature or task:

1. **Clone the repository (if needed):**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. **Ensure you're up to date with the `main` branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Create and switch into a new branch for your task:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/login-auth
   ```

## ðŸ”„ Keeping Your Branch Synced with `main`

Stay updated with changes from the `main` branch to avoid conflicts:

1. **Switch to `main` and pull the latest updates:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Switch back to your branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Merge `main` into your branch:**

   ```bash
   git merge main
   ```

4. **Resolve any merge conflicts if they appear:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts with main"
   ```

## ðŸ“¤ Pushing Your Work to the Repository

Once your work is complete:

1. **Push your branch to GitHub:**

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Open a Pull Request (PR):**

   - Navigate to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on `Compare & pull request`.
   - Ensure `main` is the base and your branch is the compare branch.
   - Add a descriptive title and explanation.
   - Submit the PR.

3. **Once reviewed and approved, merge the PR into `main`.**

4. **Pull the latest `main` locally to stay synced:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```
