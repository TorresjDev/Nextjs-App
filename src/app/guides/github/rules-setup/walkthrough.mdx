# 🌟 **Branch Protection Setup on GitHub** 🌟

Setting up branch protection on GitHub is essential to safeguard your project against accidental errors, unauthorized changes, and force pushes. This updated walkthrough reflects the latest GitHub interface and settings for creating a rule set.

## **🚀 Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up Branch Protection Rules**

## **1. 🔍 Navigate to Your Repository**

- Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log into your account.
- Navigate to the repository where branch protection is needed.

---

## **2. ⚙️ Open Repository Settings**

- Inside the repository, locate the `Settings` tab.

> 💡 **Note:** Admin access is required to access settings.

- From the left menu, select
  - `Code and automation > Branches`.
  - _OR_
  - `Code and automation > Rules > Rulesets`.

---

## **3. 🛡️ Add a New Branch Ruleset**

- #### **On Branches**
- Under Branch protection rules,

  - Click on the `Add branch ruleset` button.

- #### **On Rulesets**
- Under Rulesets rules,
  - Click on the `New ruleset` button.
    - A drop-down section will open.
    - Select `New branch ruleset`.

---

## **4. 🖋️ Configure Your Ruleset Name**

- Select a Ruleset Name based on your branch protection needs (e.g., `main` or `develop`).

---

## **5. ✅ Enforcement status**

- Enable enforcement status to active

---

## **5. 🔐 Bypass list**

- (Optional) Click dropdown Add bypass > Repository admin Role.
  - this is to allow you to bypass this rule & only you.

---

## **6. 👮 Targets**

- Add target --> All branches (recommended)
  - for best safeguard

---

## **7. 🔧 Select the Protection Rules**

Here are key rules to consider enabling based on your security needs:

- **❌ Restrict deletions**  
  _Prevents critical branches (e.g., `main`) from being deleted._

- **🔏 Require signed commits**  
  _Verifies that commits are from trusted authors, improving security._

- **✅ Require pull request reviews before merging**  
  _Ensures changes are reviewed and approved before merging._

  - **✅ Required approvals set to: 1** (_at least for best security_)
  - _Ensures the number of approving reviews that are required before a pull request can be merged._

  - **✅ Require review from Code Owners**  
    _Require an approving review in pull requests that modify files that have a designated code owner._

- **🔍 Require status checks to pass before merging**  
  _Ensures CI/CD workflows, tests, or builds complete successfully._

  - **🔍 Require branches to be up to date before merging**  
    _Whether pull requests targeting a matching branch must be tested with the latest code._
  - _This setting will not take effect unless at least one status check is enabled._

- **🚫 Block force pushes**  
  _Prevents overwriting commit history and accidental changes._

> **Recommended Setup for Single Projects:**
>
> - ✅ Require pull request reviews
> - ✅ Require status checks
> - ✅ Prevent force pushes
> - ✅ Restrict deletions

## **Optional Enhancements:**

- **👨‍💼 Include administrators**  
  _Enforces the rules even for project admins._

- **📊 Require status checks on specific CI/CD workflows**  
  _Customize which checks must pass before merging._

---

## **8. 💾 Save the Protection Rules**

- Once your rules are configured, click **Create** or **Save changes**.

---

## **🔑 Why Branch Protection Matters**

Branch protection reduces risks by:

- **🚫 Preventing accidental overwrites**
- **🔍 Ensuring code quality through reviews**
- **🔒 Improving security with signed commits**
- **🤝 Fostering collaboration and accountability**

For a robust workflow, consider combining branch protection with GitHub Actions for automated checks and CI/CD processes.

---

## **💡 Final Tip**

Regularly review and update branch protection settings as your project evolves. Ensure all team members understand their role in maintaining the project’s security and stability.
