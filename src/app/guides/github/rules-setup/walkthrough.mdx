Setting up branch protection on GitHub is essential to safeguard your project against accidental errors, unauthorized changes, and force pushes. This updated walkthrough reflects the latest GitHub interface and settings for creating a rule set.

---

## **🚀 Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up Branch Protection Rules**

### **1. 🔍 Navigate to Your Repository**

- Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log into your account.
- Navigate to the repository where branch protection is needed.

---

### **2. ⚙️ Open Repository Settings**

- Inside the repository, locate the `Settings` tab.
  > 💡 **Note:** Admin access is required to access settings.
- From the left menu, select:
  - `Code and automation > Branches`
  - _OR_
  - `Code and automation > Rules > Rulesets`

---

### **3. 🛡️ Add a New Branch Ruleset**

- **On Branches:**
  - Click on the `Add branch ruleset` button.
- **On Rulesets:**
  - Click on the `New ruleset` button
    - Select `New branch ruleset`

---

### **4. 🖋️ Configure Your Ruleset Name**

- Replace the default or generic name with something meaningful.
- 📌 **Recommended name:** `protected-branches`, `main-deploy-guard`, or `secure-workflow-rules`
- Use names that reflect the purpose of the rule for clarity and professionalism.

---

### **5. ✅ Enforcement Status**

- Enable the **Enforcement status** to `Active`

---

### **6. 🔐 Bypass List**

- 🔧 **Recommended:** Add `Repository admin` role to the bypass list.
  - This allows the repository owner to bypass the rules when necessary.
  - Especially useful for solo projects.

---

### **7. 🎯 Target Branches**

- Add target: **All branches** ✅
- Ensure default branch is also included.
- This helps reduce:
  - Merge issues
  - Deployment delays
  - CI/CD errors
  - Overall trial-and-error frustrations

---

### **8. 🔧 Select the Protection Rules**

Enable the following protection rules:

- **❌ Restrict deletions**

  - Prevents deletion of critical branches like `main` or `deploy`.

- **🔏 Require signed commits**

  - Verifies commit authorship and improves trust.

- **✅ Require pull request reviews before merging**

  - Set `Required approvals` to at least `1`
  - Enable `Require review from Code Owners` if applicable
  - Enable at least one Allowed merge methods `Merge, Squash, Rebase` if applicable

- **🔍 Require status checks to pass before merging**

  - Ensures tests/builds pass before merge
  - ✅ **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
    - Forces PRs to be synced with the latest base branch

- **📊 Status Checks (Examples)**

  - Add your relevant checks:
    - `Vercel (Production)` ✅ if deploying via Vercel
    - Any GitHub Actions like `ci/test`, `build`, `lint`, etc.
  - These checks prevent broken code from entering main branches

- **🚫 Block force pushes**
  - Prevents overwriting commit history and accidental changes.

---

### **9. 💾 Save the Protection Rules**

- Once all settings are confirmed, click **Create** or **Save changes**

---

### **🔑 Why Branch Protection Matters**

Branch protection reduces risks by:

- ❌ Preventing accidental overwrites
- ✅ Enforcing code reviews
- 🔐 Enhancing commit security
- 🔄 Ensuring CI/CD stability

---

### **💡 Final Tip**

Review and refine your rules as your project grows. Keep your checks, reviewers, and target branches updated for a smooth and secure workflow.
