# <div align="center">🚀 Modern Git Workflow Commands</div>

---

This document outlines safe, modern, and professional Git commands for creating, syncing, and contributing to repositories. Ideal for solo or team-based projects.

---

## 📌 Create a New Repository (From Scratch)

```bash
# Create a README and initialize Git
echo "# Project_React" >> README.md

# Initialize local repo
git init

# Stage README for commit
git add README.md

# First commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Rename default branch to 'main'
git branch -M main

# Add remote GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/JxTorres003/Project_React.git

# Push to GitHub and track
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 📤 Push an Existing Project to GitHub

```bash
# Add the GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/JxTorres003/Project_React.git

# Ensure your branch is named 'main'
git branch -M main

# Push and track
git push -u origin main
```

> 💡 Always run `git remote -v` to check if the remote already exists.

---

## 🧪 Pulling Latest Main Into Dev Branch (Rebase Recommended)

### ✅ Update your dev or feature branch safely:

```bash
# Make sure you're on your dev branch
git checkout your-branch

# Pull latest from main with rebase (recommended)
git pull origin main --rebase
```

> 🔄 Rebase keeps history clean — avoids merge commits.

---

## 🧼 Daily Workflow: Add ➕ Commit 💬 Push 🚀

```bash
# See uncommitted changes
git status

# Stage all changes
git add -A

# Commit with message
git commit -m "💡 Added new feature section to layout"

# Push to current branch
git push
```

> ✅ If it's the first push of a new branch:

```bash
git push -u origin your-branch
```

---

## 🔁 Keeping Branches in Sync

```bash
# Always rebase before merging to main
git checkout your-branch
git pull origin main --rebase
```

```bash
# Then push your rebased branch
git push --force-with-lease
```

> ⚠️ Use `--force-with-lease` only when rebasing — safe push that respects teammate updates.

---

## 📥 Merging Dev Branch Into Main

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Pull latest to ensure synced
git pull origin main

# Merge your finished feature branch
git merge your-branch

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

> 🔐 Tip: Protect your `main` branch on GitHub to require pull requests.

---

## 🧹 Delete Local & Remote Branches (Clean-up)

```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -D old-branch

# Delete from GitHub
git push origin --delete old-branch
```
