## 📁 Create a GitHub Repository from Scratch

### 1️⃣ Create a Repository on GitHub

- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
- Click the "+" ➜ **New Repository**
- Fill in:
  - **Repository Name** (e.g., `donations-jar`) 🏷️
  - **Description** (optional) 📝
  - Set visibility to **Public** or **Private** 🔓
  - Leave README/.gitignore/license **unchecked** (we’ll handle them locally) ❌
- Click **Create Repository** ✅

---

### 2️⃣ Clone It Locally or Initialize a New One

```bash
# Option A: Cloning a GitHub Repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name

# Option B: Initializing Locally
cd /path/to/your/project
git init
echo "# project-name" >> README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

### 3️⃣ Connect and Push to GitHub

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

✅ You now have a live repo connected to GitHub.

---

## 🔁 Migrate an Old Repo Into a New One

### 🛠️ Prep: Be on the Main Branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

🎯 Ensures you're working on the latest version of your main branch.

---

### 📦 Move Files Into New Repo Structure

Place files into a meaningful directory:

```bash
src/app/guides/
```

---

### 💾 Commit & Push the Merge

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "🚀 Migrated walkthrough-guides into Nextjs-App"
git push
```

---

### 🔍 Confirm It Worked

#### 🔎 Check Git Log:

```bash
git log -- src/app/guides
```

#### 🌐 Run or View the App

- Run it locally or check deployment
- Visit new file paths (e.g., `/guides`)
- Confirm UI, links, and components work

---

## 🧼 Safely Retire the Old Repository

After confirming the migration:

1. Go to the **old repo** on GitHub
2. Go to **Settings** ➜ Scroll to bottom
3. Click **Delete this repository**
4. Type the repo name to confirm

> 🔐 Safe: Your history now lives in the new repo.

---

## 🧪 Optional: Log the Migration

```bash
mkdir notes
nano notes/migration-log.md
```

Example log:

```
- 📦 Merged: walkthrough-guides ➜ Nextjs-App
- ✅ Verified: git log, browser render, deployment check
- 🗑️ Retired: walkthrough-guides
- 📅 Date: May 17, 2025
```
