# 📁 GitHub Repository Workflow Guide

This guide combines everything you need to know to **create**, **organize**, **migrate**, and **retire** repositories in a professional Git workflow. Use this as a one-stop reference.

---

## 🛠️ Create a New GitHub Repository (from Scratch)

### 1. Create Repo on GitHub

* Name it clearly (e.g., `project-name`) ✅
* Add a README and `.gitignore` (Node if using JavaScript/Next.js)
* Optional: Add a license (MIT is common)

### 2. Clone It to Local Machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 3. Create Project Files (Optional)

```bash
npm init -y
npm install
```

### 4. Add, Commit, and Push

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

> ✅ You're now fully connected between local and remote.

## 🔁 How to Migrate and Retire a Repository

This section walks you through merging an old repo (e.g., `walkthrough-guides`) into a new one (e.g., `nextjs-app`).

### 1️⃣ Checkout Main Branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

> 🎯 Ensures you're working with the latest version.

### 2️⃣ Copy Old Files Into New Repo

Copy your old project (e.g., `walkthrough-guides`) into the new repo under a relevant directory:

```bash
src/app/guides/
```

### 3️⃣ Commit the Migration

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "🚀 Migrated walkthrough-guides into nextjs-app"
git push
```

> 📦 Now your GitHub remote includes the merged repo.

### 4️⃣ Validate It

* Check file paths in the browser (localhost or live)
* Use `git log` to confirm commit history:

```bash
git log -- src/app/guides
```

---

## 🧼 Safely Delete the Old Repo

After confirming everything:

1. Go to old GitHub repo → Settings → Scroll down
2. Click **Delete this repository**
3. Type repo name to confirm

> 🔐 Safe to delete — Git history is preserved in the new repo.

## 🧠 Git Concepts Summary

| Concept            | Explanation                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Commits            | Full snapshots of your repo at a point in time           |
| Branches           | Pointers to specific commits                             |
| `git log -- path/` | Shows commit history tied to specific folders            |
| `git push`         | Makes your commits appear on GitHub                      |
| Deleting a repo    | Doesn’t affect another repo that now holds those commits |
